## New
The [CSE](./CSE) folder has the newer sheet template, compatible with the newer [Character Sheet Enhancement(CSE)](https://wiki.roll20.net/CSE)-format.


## Old
The [LCS](./LCS) folder contains the barebones sheet example I made in 2019, which works for [Legacy Character Sheets(LCS)](https://wiki.roll20.net/Legacy_Sheet). **Not recommended**
